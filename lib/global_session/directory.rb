module GlobalSession
  # The global session directory, which provides lookup and decision services
  # to instances of Session.
  #
  # The default implementation is simplistic, but should be suitable for most applications.
  # Directory is designed to be specialized via subclassing. To override the behavior to
  # suit your needs, simply create a subclass of Directory and add a configuration file
  # setting to specify the class name of your implementation:  
  #
  #     common:
  #       directory:
  #         class: MyCoolDirectory
  #
  # == Key Management
  #
  # All key-related functionality has been delegated to the Keystore class as of
  # v3.1. Directory retains its key management hooks for downrev compatibility,
  # but mostly they are stubs for Keystore functionality.
  #
  # For more information about key mangement, please refer to the Keystore class.
  #
